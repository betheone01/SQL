1) Create a database named college.
  => CREATE DATABASE college;

2) Create a table name student in college database with following structure roll,name,class,marks,age with respective datatypes.
  
 => CREATE TABLE college.student
    (
      roll INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      class INT NOT NULL,
      marks INT NOT NULL,
      age INT NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (roll)
    );

3) Apply the following MySQL clause to this table.
  Creating =>
  ALTER TABLE college.student.
  ADD CONSTRAINT chk_marks CHECK (marks >= 0 AND marks <= 100);
  
  Altering=>
  ALTER TABLE college.student
  MODIFY CONSTRAINT chk_marks CHECK (marks >= 0 AND marks <= 120);
  
  Dropping Constraints=>
  ALTER TABLE college.student
  DROP CONSTRAINT chk_marks;

4) Aggregate Functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), COUNT(), Group By, Having
   Clause =>
    -- Get the sum of marks of all students.
    SELECT SUM(marks) AS total_marks FROM college.student;
    
    -- Get the average marks of all students.
    SELECT AVG(marks) AS average_marks FROM college.student;
    
    -- Get the number of students in each class.
    SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS num_students FROM college.student GROUP BY class;
    
    -- Get the highest and lowest marks of all students.
    SELECT MAX(marks) AS highest_marks, MIN(marks) AS lowest_marks FROM college.student;

5) Using Like, Distinct, Order By, Between...And
  
    =>
    -- Find all students whose name starts with the letter 'A'.
    SELECT * FROM college.student WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
    
    -- Find all students who have a unique name.
    SELECT DISTINCT name FROM college.student;
    
    -- Find all students who are in class 10 and have marks between 80 and 90.
    SELECT * FROM college.student WHERE class = 10 AND marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90 ORDER BY marks DESC;


6) Comparing Nulls, Using IN/Not-In
   =>
    -- Find all students who have a null value in the age column.
    SELECT * FROM college.student WHERE age IS NULL;
  
   -- Find all students who have a non-null value in the age column.
   SELECT * FROM college.student WHERE age IS NOT NULL;
